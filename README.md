==============

Overview
--------------------------
cps2_digiav is an add-on for Capcom CP System II and some other arcade boards. It enables digital video and audio output via HDMI connector. The project consists of a common interface PCB (`pcb/`) and board-specific FPGA firmware (`board/<board>/output_files/cps2_digiav.jic`).

Supported boards
--------------------------
* CPS1 (89626A)
* CPS2
* CPS3
* Neo Geo (MV1C and AES3-3, possibly others as well)
* Toaplan V2

Hardware
--------------------------
The add-on [PCB](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/fxG9hou9) design can be self-built or bought [pre-assembled](https://videogameperfection.com/products/cps2-cps3-digital-av-interface-diy-kit/).

* Installation typically requires a small number of additional components which are listed in board-specific READMEs.
